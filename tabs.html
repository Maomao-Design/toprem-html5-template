                                        be about the lifestyle you hope to lead in retirement. Or a child's education. There
                                        might be a charitable cause you hope to support more fully, or a hobby you've yearned
                                        to pursue. Or perhaps you're just not quite able to articulate your goal. But we
                                        bet you have one, nevertheless. Understanding what's really important to you is at
                                        the heart of how we'll begin to build the kind of relationship you expect. Step by
                                        step, in a way that is very personal, very open and very focused on your hopes and
                                        dreams and goals. Wealth management is very straightforward. From the affluent individual’s
                                        perspective, wealth management is simply the science of solving/enhancing his or
                                        her financial situation. From the financial advisor’s perspective, wealth management
                                        is the ability of an advisor or advisory team to deliver a full range of financial
                                        services and products to an affluent client in a consultative way. Theoretically,
                                        a wealth manager can provide every single financial product in existence. In reality
                                        most wealth managers specialize in services and products they feel most comfortable

                                        losses pressure. Yellow oxygen masks deploy from the ceiling, begging to be used.
                                        You start reaching for the lifeline but your child sitting next to you screams for
                                        help. What’s your next move? If you follow the preflight safety instructions, you
                                        put on your own mask before assisting others, no questions asked. After all, it’s
                                        difficult to help others if you don’t help yourself first. This seems straightforward
                                        when we’re flying through the sky, but a recent report from T. Rowe Price reveals
                                        that it becomes cloudy when we’re on the ground, handling money, as an alarming number
                                        of parents are putting their own retirements at risk in order to fund their children’s
                                        college expenses. Nine out of 10 parents believe their children will attend college,
                                        and since college typically arrives before retirement, the majority of parents feel
                                        like they should put money toward that first and save for retirement after. In fact,
                                        49% of parents are willing to delay their own retirements to pay for their children’s
                                        education, while 74% feel guilty they won’t be able to provide more financial assistance.
                                        Overall, 63% are concerned about their children having enough financial resources

                                    <p>Insurance & Annuities. Annuities are financial tools that can be used for receiving potential
                                        guaranteed income in retirement. Various types of annuities let you choose which
                                        benefits matter most and how often you are paid. All are tax-friendly, meaning you
                                        don't pay taxes on them until you receive your annuity or income payments, which
                                        are usually when you're in retirement and could be taxed at a lower rate. Allstate
                                        offers a variety of solutions from leading financial service providers, so you have
                                        many options when deciding what type of annuity is right for you. How Annuities Work:
                                        Learning more about annuities can help you understand what options are available
                                        to you. An Allstate personal financial representative can answers questions you have
                                        about the following features:Lasting income: An annuity is a contract between you
                                        and an insurance company. They invest your money and provide a regular source of
                                        income that you can receive a paycheck for life, depending on the contract selections
                                        you make. Tax advantages: Your earnings are not taxed until withdrawn. This means
                                        that when you typically start receiving your annuity or income payments, they could
                                        be taxed at a lower rate, making annuities an attractive savings option...</p>

                                        charged quarterly in advance, based on the total value of the assets in your account
                                        at the end of the previous quarter. Unless otherwise noted, the asset-based fee generally

                                        that saw the Dow Jones industrial average lose 10 percent of its value and the Standard
                                        & Poor's 500 index slip below the magical 2,000 barrier – I have two words of advice
                                        for gun-shy investors. Don't panic. "We're starting to get some calls, as should
                                        be expected," says Erik Jensen, president and founder of Jensen Wealth Advisors in

                                        with them; nobody likes seeing drops like last week. However, we recommend they keep
                                        a long-term perspective, understanding that corrections are the norm, not a calamity."
                                        Sure, last week may have felt like a calamity if you were watching your portfolio
                                        shrink by the hour. But there were tell-tale signs – after riding an extraordinary

                                        this month. Then the market's softening became a full-blown meltdown Thursday and

                                        perspective, wealth management is simply the science of solving/enhancing his or
                                        her financial situation. From the financial advisor’s perspective, wealth management
                                        is the ability of an advisor or advisory team to deliver a full range of financial
                                        services and products to an affluent client in a consultative way. Theoretically,
                                        a wealth manager can provide every single financial product in existence. In reality

                                        and since college typically arrives before retirement, the majority of parents feel

                                    <p>Insurance & Annuities. Annuities are financial tools that can be used for receiving potential
                                        guaranteed income in retirement. Various types of annuities let you choose which
                                        benefits matter most and how often you are paid. All are tax-friendly, meaning you
                                        don't pay taxes on them until you receive your annuity or income payments, which
                                        are usually when you're in retirement and could be taxed at a lower rate. Allstate
                                        offers a variety of solutions from leading financial service providers, so you have
                                        many options when deciding what type of annuity is right for you. How Annuities Work:
                                        Learning more about annuities can help you understand what options are available

                                        about the following features:Lasting income: An annuity is a contract between you
                                        and an insurance company. They invest your money and provide a regular source of
                                        income that you can receive a paycheck for life, depending on the contract selections
                                        you make. Tax advantages: Your earnings are not taxed until withdrawn. This means
                                        that when you typically start receiving your annuity or income payments, they could
                                        be taxed at a lower rate, making annuities an attractive savings option...</p>

                                        49% of parents are willing to delay their own retirements to pay for their children’s
                                        education, while 74% feel guilty they won’t be able to provide more financial assistance.

                                        be about the lifestyle you hope to lead in retirement. Or a child's education. There
                                        might be a charitable cause you hope to support more fully, or a hobby you've yearned
                                        to pursue. Or perhaps you're just not quite able to articulate your goal. But we
                                        bet you have one, nevertheless. Understanding what's really important to you is at
                                        the heart of how we'll begin to build the kind of relationship you expect. Step by
                                        step, in a way that is very personal, very open and very focused on your hopes and
                                        dreams and goals. Wealth management is very straightforward. From the affluent individual’s
                                        perspective, wealth management is simply the science of solving/enhancing his or
                                        her financial situation. From the financial advisor’s perspective, wealth management
                                        is the ability of an advisor or advisory team to deliver a full range of financial
                                        services and products to an affluent client in a consultative way. Theoretically,
                                        a wealth manager can provide every single financial product in existence. In reality
                                        most wealth managers specialize in services and products they feel most comfortable

                                        losses pressure. Yellow oxygen masks deploy from the ceiling, begging to be used.
                                        You start reaching for the lifeline but your child sitting next to you screams for
